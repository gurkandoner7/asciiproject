Hello Everyone,

I aimed to create a coffee purchasing platform in this project. For a significant portion of the design, I utilized a ready-made template that I found on a forum. My purpose in using a ready-made template was to demonstrate my ability to use the UI of any project in a code environment.

I converted many components from the design into CustomView classes and used them in different parts of the application. I am aware of the importance of creating CustomViews for code integrity from my previous projects, and I wanted to implement the same approach in my own project.

In this application, I followed the MVVM architecture and used Hilt for dependency injection. I managed the processes in the application through fragments for performance and manageability. I placed great emphasis on the readability of the code and strived to adhere to clean code principles.

Some of the technologies I used in the application include;
- MVVM
- Hilt
- Flows
- Coroutines
- SharedPreferences 
- ViewBinding 
- Glide.

At this stage, the application is capable of testing the UI of features such as "purchase, favorites, filtering, language switching" using mock data.

You're welcome! Thank you for allowing me to review your project.
