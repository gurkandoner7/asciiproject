    <string name="desc">A cappuccino is an approximately 150 ml (5 oz) beverage, with 25 ml of espresso coffee and 85 ml of fresh milk. The foam on top of the cappuccino is made by steaming and frothing the milk, which gives it a creamy and velvety texture. The espresso coffee is brewed using high-pressure hot water that is forced through finely ground coffee beans, resulting in a strong and concentrated flavor.</string>
